# TODO

* consider [this post](https://medium.com/@benbjohnson/standard-package-layout-7cdbc8391fc1) idea about organising packages by dependency... I think I'm sort of doing this naturally

probably better to go with [the docs](https://go.dev/doc/modules/layout) opinion on this

# Interesting Go stuff

## default config values 

thinking through what happens if they user deletes values - do they get what they expect?

```chatGPT
If your config file is missing a value (e.g., LoadOnStartup), the LoadConfig function will still decode the JSON into the Config struct, but the missing value will be set to the zero value for its type. For example:

A missing bool field like LoadOnStartup will default to false.
A missing int field will default to 0.
A missing string field will default to an empty string ("").
```

This would effectively result in one or more of the following
var defaultConfig = Config{
	DailyStartTime:              "",
	DailyEndTime:                "",
	BreakBetweenGamesMinutes:    0,
	BreakBetweenSessionsMinutes: 0,
	GamesPerSession:             0,
	MinimumGameDurationMinutes:  0,
	LobbyCloseDelaySeconds:      0,
	LoadOnStartup:               false,
	StartupInstalled:            false,
}

DailyStartTime - confirmed code includes "" check to disable OK
DailyEndTime - confirmed code includes "" check to disable OK
BreakBetweenGamesMinutes - disables the break OK
BreakBetweenSessionsMinutes - disables the break OK
GamesPerSession - setting 0 disables this restriction OK
MinimumGameDurationMinutes - this disables the remake functionality but is probably fine
LobbyCloseDelaySeconds - this will be 0 by default OK
LoadOnStartup/StartupInstalled - default of false for both means the install/uninstall won't happen - probably OK but could be more robust + less efficient to always check for tasks in task scheduler if LoadOnStartup is false (and hence pick up the scenario where they want to uninstall it and do so by deleting the line LoadOnStartup true) -> make the change to always check

## No virtual environments

```chatGPT
Uninstalling a Go-installed binary
Go doesn't have a go uninstall command. If you installed rsrc using:

go install github.com/akavel/rsrc@latest
it placed the binary in your Go bin directory (usually $GOBIN or ~/go/bin on Unix-like systems, %USERPROFILE%\go\bin on Windows).

To remove it, simply delete the binary manually:

rm $(which rsrc)   # Linux/macOS
del %USERPROFILE%\go\bin\rsrc.exe  # Windows (Command Prompt)
Remove-Item $env:GOBIN\rsrc.exe  # Windows (PowerShell)
If you're unsure where it was installed, run:

which rsrc   # Linux/macOS
where rsrc   # Windows
and delete the file.

Does go install install per module?
No, go install installs globally (not per module). Unlike Python virtual environments, Go places binaries in a system-wide location ($GOBIN or $GOPATH/bin). The installed binary is available system-wide, regardless of which project or module you're in.

If you want project-specific dependencies, you'd typically use:

go get github.com/akavel/rsrc
which downloads the package into your module's go.mod, but that wouldn't install a CLI tool—just the library for use in your Go code.

Go doesn't use virtual environments like Python, as it manages dependencies at the module level via go.mod and go.sum.

## Generating the icon

* Used leonardo.ai to generate a version of the League of Legends logo with 3 boxes around it (nod to the three block process)
* Used random website to convert .jpg to .ico
* Used rsrc to generate .syso file
* did not work
* Found Python script that uses PIL to generate .icon ensuring all the different sizes, useful tool for future
* rebuild with 
rsrc -ico assets/lolmonitor.ico -o cmd/lolmonitor/lolmonitor.syso
go build -o build/lolmonitor.exe cmd/lolmonitor/main.go
* did not work
* downhload resourcehacker from https://www.angusj.com/resourcehacker/ to inspect the exe and see if icon is present under ICON or GROUP_ICON section

* consider trying this instead
https://github.com/josephspurrier/goversioninfo?tab=readme-ov-file

* contains a link to [the docs](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/menurc/resource-definition-statements?redirectedfrom=MSDN)

* actually try this, simpler

```chatGPT
go-winres is a pure Go library and CLI tool for embedding resources into Windows executables. It doesn't require external dependencies like MinGW.​
Reddit

Steps:

Install go-winres:
go install github.com/tc-hib/go-winres@latest

Generate the .syso File:
Navigate to your project's directory and run:
go-winres simply --icon assets/lolmonitor.ico

1. Understanding Architecture-Specific .syso Files:

_amd64.syso: Used when building a 64-bit (amd64) executable.​

_386.syso: Used when building a 32-bit (386) executable.​

If you're exclusively building for a 64-bit architecture, you only need the _amd64.syso file. However, if you plan to build for both 32-bit and 64-bit architectures, you'll need both .syso files. The Go build system will automatically include the appropriate .syso file based on the target architecture during the build process.​

2. Renaming the .syso File:

You can rename the .syso file to something like lolmonitor_windows_amd64.syso. The naming convention *_windows_amd64.syso helps the Go build system identify the correct resource file for the specified operating system and architecture. Ensure that the renamed file is placed in the same directory as your main package or adjust your build process accordingly.

When building your Go executable for a specific architecture, set the GOARCH environment variable accordingly:​

For 64-bit:

SET GOARCH=amd64
go build -o lolmonitor.exe -ldflags "-H windowsgui" cmd/lolmonitor/main.go
For 32-bit:

SET GOARCH=386
go build -o lolmonitor.exe -ldflags "-H windowsgui" cmd/lolmonitor/main.go
```

```chatGPT

Adding an Icon to the Executable
Go does not natively support embedding icons into .exe files, but you can achieve this using a .syso resource file.

Steps:
Create an .ico file
You need a .ico file for your application. You can create one online or use an image editor like GIMP.

Generate a .syso file
Use rsrc to embed the icon:

Install rsrc (if not installed):

sh
Copy
Edit
go install github.com/akavel/rsrc@latest
Generate a .syso file:

sh
Copy
Edit
rsrc -ico youricon.ico -o icon.syso
Place icon.syso in the same directory as main.go or in the root directory of your Go module.

Rebuild your executable

sh
Copy
Edit
go build -o lolmonitor.exe cmd/lolmonitor/main.go
Now lolmonitor.exe will have the icon.

```

## Project organisation

```chatGPT
I am relatively new to Go and I'm doing a refactor of my first project. I'm learning as I go with an emphasis on adopting good/best practices from the outset, but without wanting to read all the docs, blog posts etc.

I read this post, which is now 9 years old: https://medium.com/@benbjohnson/standard-package-layout-7cdbc8391fc1

It seems to suggest a few interesting things in terms of organising your Go projects, which if I understand correctly are:
- having packages organised generally in folders by dependency, with multiple .go and _test.go files for different modules 
- declaring structs in the main program but using them in the modules
- having a mock system which creates dummy versions of the structs for _test.go files to use

I have a few questions for you to help me with:
1. Is my understanding of the post correct? Any issues with my terminology so far? e.g. I'm using packages and modules without necessarily knowing exactly what I'm talking about
2. Is this approach still a good one for me to use, or have things evolved in the past 9 years? 
3. Even if I do decide to broadly adopt this approach, what are some potential things I might need to be aware of? For example, I was thinking about "what happens if I have a venn diagram style series of modules, where I have a module that uses dependency A, a module that uses dependency B, and a module that uses both dependency A and B? Do I put all three into the same package or into different packages?
4. I'm still a little unsure of how the mock system works. Would this be a package with a single file that declares a bunch of mock versions of structs in the same way that the main.go program will declare the real version of structs?
5. If I have modA and modB as .go files in the folder libA, and I have modA and modB _test.go files in that directory, confirm if I can run the _test.go files separately?

For reference, my folder structure currently looks like this
├── .gitignore
├── LICENSE
├── README.md
├── assets
│   ├── lolmonitor.ico     
│   └── lolmonitor.jpg     
├── build

│   │   └── terminator_test.go
│   └── windowDetect
│       ├── detector.go
│       └── detector_test.go
└── scripts

I'm thinking of 
* combining windowClose and windowDetect into a window package as both of these import "github.com/StackExchange/wmi"
* renaming terminator to close to have window.close and detector to detect so I have window.detect
* renaming loadOnStartup to use a short single word such as startup
* removing the scripts folder, I don't think I'll be using it
* adding a mock package if it makes sense to do so

6. Any other suggestions for my folder structure?

7. Explain the difference between import and install?

My main.go package looks like this:

// To run (in terminal, at project root): go run cmd/lolmonitor/main.go
// To build: go build -o lolmonitor.exe -ldflags "-H windowsgui" cmd/lolmonitor/main.go
// -ldflags "-H windowsgui"   -- hides the terminal
package main

	actions "github.com/alextgould/lolmonitor/internal/windowClose"
	detection "github.com/alextgould/lolmonitor/internal/windowDetect"
)

func main() {
	// Load configuration
	cfg, err := config.LoadConfig("config.json")
	if err != nil {
		log.Panicf("Failed to load config: %v", err)
	}

	// Start window monitoring
	log.Println("Starting lolmonitor")
	gameEvents := make(chan detection.GameEvent, 10) // Buffered channel to prevent blocking
	quit := make(chan struct{})
	go detection.StartMonitoring(gameEvents, quit)

	// Handle Ctrl+C for graceful shutdown
	signalChan := make(chan os.Signal, 1)
	signal.Notify(signalChan, os.Interrupt)
	go func() {
		<-signalChan
		log.Println("Shutting down lolmonitor")
		close(quit) // Signal monitoring to stop
		os.Exit(0)
	}()

	var gameStartTime time.Time
	var gameEndTime time.Time
	var gameDuration time.Duration
	var breakDuration time.Duration
	var endOfBreak time.Time
	var sessionGames int

	for event := range gameEvents { // will process events as they are added to the gameEvents channel by the StartMonitoring goroutine, which runs constantly
		switch event.Type { // type of event (lobby_open, lobby_close, game_open, game_close)
		case "game_open": // note the game start time, so we can check for remakes
			log.Println("Game started")
			gameStartTime = event.Timestamp

		case "game_close": // check for remakes, increment game counter
			log.Println("Game ended")
			gameEndTime = event.Timestamp
			gameDuration = gameEndTime.Sub(gameStartTime)
			if gameDuration < time.Duration(cfg.MinimumGameDurationMinutes)*time.Minute {
				log.Println("Game was too short, likely a remake.")
				continue
			}
			sessionGames++
			log.Printf("Games played this session: %d of %d", sessionGames, cfg.GamesPerSession)
			if sessionGames >= cfg.GamesPerSession && cfg.GamesPerSession != 0 { // use 0 to disable GamesPerSession functionality
				sessionGames = 0
				breakDuration = time.Duration(cfg.BreakBetweenSessionsMinutes) * time.Minute
				log.Printf("Enforcing a session ban of %v minutes", cfg.BreakBetweenSessionsMinutes)
			} else {
				breakDuration = time.Duration(cfg.BreakBetweenGamesMinutes) * time.Minute
				log.Printf("Enforcing a game ban of %v minutes", cfg.BreakBetweenGamesMinutes)
			}
			endOfBreak = gameEndTime.Add(breakDuration)

			// always close the lobby after a game, unless breakDuration is 0
			if breakDuration > 0 {

				log.Printf("Closing the lobby. Break will expire at: %v", endOfBreak.Format("2006/01/02 15:04:05"))

				err := actions.CloseLeagueClient()
				if err != nil {
					log.Printf("Error: %v", err)
				}

				notification_text := fmt.Sprintf("GG. Take a break and come back in %.0f minutes at %v",
					math.Ceil(time.Until(endOfBreak).Minutes()),
					endOfBreak.Format("3:04pm"))
				sendNotification("League of Legends Lobby Closed", notification_text)
			}

		case "lobby_open": // check if we are in a break, if so, close the lobby and inform the user
			log.Println("Lobby was opened")
			if time.Now().Before(endOfBreak) {

				log.Println("Closing the lobby, which was opened during an enforced break.")

				err := actions.CloseLeagueClient()
				if err != nil {
					log.Printf("Error: %v", err)
				}

				notification_text := fmt.Sprintf("You're on a break! Try again in %.0f minutes at %v",
					math.Ceil(time.Until(endOfBreak).Minutes()),
					endOfBreak.Format("3:04pm"))
				sendNotification("League of Legends Blocked", notification_text)
			}

		case "lobby_close": // will happen when we close the lobby, or when the user closes the lobby, either way ignore
			continue

		default: // should never occur
			log.Panicf("Unknown event type: %v", event.Type)
		}
	}
}

func sendNotification(title, message string) {
	notification := toast.Notification{
		AppID:   "LoL Monitor",
		Title:   title,
		Message: message,
	}
	err := notification.Push()
	if err != nil {
		log.Printf("Failed to send notification: %v", err)
	}
}

Broadly, the program monitors for certain game windows appearing and force closes them under certain conditions, based on the number of games played in a row etc. In addition to moving the notifications logic into the toast.go folder (which I've already done, I just need to remove it from the main.go file), I'm thinking I should add another package in internal that handles some of the logic I currently have in main.go, so I can test it properly. I think this would allow me to pass dummy times for checking time of day restrictions (not currently implemented) as well as create dummy events (game open, game close, lobby open etc) to test the logic. Am I on the right track with my thinking?

Any other thoughts or tips before I start my refactoring exercise?




ChatGPT said:
Thought for a second
Below is an overview addressing each of your questions, along with some clarifications and suggestions:

1. Understanding the Post & Terminology
Your summary is largely correct. Just to clarify:

Packages vs. Modules:
In Go, a package is a collection of Go files in the same directory that share the same package name. A module is a collection of related packages defined by a go.mod file and used for versioning and dependency management. Ben’s post (see 
MEDIUM.COM
) sometimes uses these terms loosely. It’s good to know the precise definitions as you progress.

Mocking:
The post suggests using a separate mock package to provide dummy implementations for testing. That concept is sound and aligns with dependency injection principles.

2. Relevance of the Approach After 9 Years
The overall approach remains useful today. However, some things have evolved:

Go Modules: Now, modules are the standard for dependency management, which simplifies project organization.

Community Practices: Many developers now also consider domain-driven and layered architectures (see also the updated discussions on GitHub and various blog posts).

Testing & Mocks: There are more tools (like GoMock and Testify) that can simplify your mocking, but the core idea of isolating business logic remains the same.

3. Handling Overlapping Dependencies
If you have components that use different sets of dependencies—say, one uses dependency A, another uses dependency B, and a third uses both—you have a couple of options:

Separate Packages:
You can keep them in separate packages if they represent distinct concerns. For shared functionality (when both A and B are needed), you might create a third package that acts as an adapter or aggregator.

Avoiding Circular Dependencies:
Use dependency injection to break potential cycles. Extract common interfaces or helper functions into their own package so that modules remain decoupled.

4. How the Mock System Works
Yes, you’re on the right track. Typically, you’d:

Define Interfaces:
Design your code so that it depends on interfaces rather than concrete types.

Create Mocks:
Write (or generate) mock implementations—often placed in a separate package (e.g. internal/mocks or a similar name). These mocks usually mirror the real implementations but let you control their behavior in tests.
Tools like GoMock can automate this, but writing simple mocks yourself is perfectly fine.

5. Running _test.go Files Separately
If you have files like modA.go, modB.go and their corresponding _test.go files in the same folder (e.g. in your libA directory), you can run tests for that package with:

bash
Copy
Edit
go test ./libA
All _test.go files in that package are compiled and run together. You can also run tests for specific files if needed by providing the file name, but generally, running go test on the package is standard practice.

6. Additional Suggestions for Your Folder Structure
Your current structure is quite good. A few additional thoughts:

Combining Related Packages:
If windowClose and windowDetect both import the same external dependency (e.g. "github.com/StackExchange/wmi"), merging them into a single package (e.g. window) can reduce duplication. Then you can expose methods like window.Close() and window.Detect().

Naming:
Renaming for clarity (e.g. using shorter names like startup instead of loadOnStartup) is a good idea. It makes your API easier to use.

Mocks:
Consider adding a dedicated mocks package (perhaps under internal/mocks) for all your interfaces. This keeps test doubles separate from production code.

General Layout:
The overall layout (with cmd for the main binary and internal for business logic) aligns well with community best practices. You might also consider creating a pkg directory if you ever want to expose reusable packages to other projects.

7. Difference Between Import and Install
Import:
The import statement in Go code is used to include packages. It tells the compiler where to find the code you wish to use. For example, when you write import "github.com/alextgould/lolmonitor/internal/config", you’re including that package into your current file.

Install:
Running go install compiles your Go program and installs the resulting binary into your $GOBIN (or $GOPATH/bin). It’s a build step to produce an executable that you can run, rather than a directive inside your source code.

Refactoring Your Main Logic
Your idea of moving the core game logic out of main.go into its own package (within internal) is a very good one. This will help you:

Test Business Logic Independently:
You can pass in dummy times and simulate game events to verify that your logic behaves as expected.

Improve Code Organization:
It decouples the logic from the environment-specific setup (like signal handling) and makes your application easier to maintain and extend.

By considering these points and gradually refactoring, you'll be following a robust, testable, and maintainable design pattern in Go. If you have more questions or need further clarification on any point, feel free to ask!

Happy coding!







You said:
Thanks. I do need further clarification on a few things:

1. if a module is the project level, and the package is the internal subfolder level, what do you call the individual .go files within a package folder?

2. Provide more details on the "domain-driven" and layered architectures?

3. Provide more details on tools such as GoMock and Testify? Is it worth me looking into these as a beginner/hobbyist or are these more designed for large software production environments?

4. How do you define "distinct concerns"? For example, if I have a package with detect.go and close.go, both of which use WMI for monitoring of windows, but one file is concerned with detecting windows and the other is concerned with closing them, am I on the right track?

5. Tell me more about interfaces. Are these a Go data type? Give an example based on my desire to simulate Win32Process related events, where currently I define a struct like so

type Win32_Process struct {
	Name      string
	ProcessId uint32
}

and then use it in a function like this

// get the Process ID of the League Lobby window from its name
func getLobbyPID() (uint32, error) {
	var processes []Win32_Process
	query := fmt.Sprintf("SELECT Name, ProcessId FROM Win32_Process WHERE Name = '%s'", detection.LOBBY_WINDOW_NAME)

	// Retry loop with 5-second delay
	for {
		err := wmi.Query(query, &processes)
		if err == nil {
			if len(processes) > 0 {
				return processes[0].ProcessId, nil
			}
			return 0, fmt.Errorf("lobby window not found")
		}
		log.Printf("WMI query failed: %v", err)
		time.Sleep(5 * time.Second) // Delay before retrying
	}
}

within the close.go (currently terminator.go) program. What would this look like using an interface? Clarify what would be in the internal/mocks file, what would be in the close.go file, and what would be in the main.go file if relevant.

6. if I was using a pkg directory, would this mean I move things out of internal and/or rename functions to start with an uppercase letter? I don't think I want to do this, but would an example of this be, for me to create a general package that is able to detect/close windows by name, which seems like a useful reusable component, then my internal file would pick up the function from the pkg folder and use it with specific parameters for my current project?


ChatGPT said:
Certainly! Let's delve into each of your questions:

1. Naming Conventions for .go Files Within a Package
In Go, while there's no strict rule for naming individual .go files within a package, common conventions include:

Lowercase Letters: Use all lowercase letters in filenames.

Underscores for Separation: Separate multiple words with underscores for clarity.

For example, if you have a package handling user authentication, your files might be named:

login_handler.go

session_manager.go

This approach enhances readability and aligns with community practices.

2. Domain-Driven and Layered Architectures
Domain-Driven Design (DDD):

DDD focuses on modeling software based on the real-world domain it's intended to represent. Key concepts include:

Entities: Objects with a distinct identity, persisting over time.

Value Objects: Objects defined by their attributes, without a unique identity.

Aggregates: Groups of related entities and value objects treated as a single unit.

Repositories: Interfaces for accessing domain objects, encapsulating data retrieval and storage.

Layered Architecture:

This design pattern organizes code into layers, each with a specific responsibility:

Presentation Layer: Handles user interfaces and communication.

Application Layer: Coordinates application-specific operations and workflows.

Domain Layer: Contains business logic and domain models.

Infrastructure Layer: Manages technical concerns like data access and external integrations.

Combining DDD with layered architecture can lead to a well-structured, maintainable codebase that mirrors real-world domains.

3. Overview of GoMock and Testify
GoMock:

GoMock is a robust mocking framework for Go, integrating seamlessly with Go's testing package. It allows for:

Mock Generation: Uses the mockgen tool to generate mock implementations of interfaces.

Expectation Setting: Define expected method calls and their return values.

Call Order Verification: Assert the order of function calls to ensure correct interactions.

Testify:

Testify is a comprehensive toolkit offering:

Assertions Package: Simplifies common assertions in tests.

Mock Package: Facilitates the creation of mock objects without code generation.

Suite Package: Provides a structure for organizing tests.

Suitability for Beginners:

For hobbyist projects, Testify might be more approachable due to its simplicity and lack of required code generation. GoMock offers more advanced features, which can be beneficial as your projects grow in complexity.

4. Defining "Distinct Concerns" in Package Design
In Go, a package should encapsulate a single, well-defined responsibility. If detect.go and close.go both utilize WMI for window monitoring but serve different purposes (detection vs. closing), consider:

Single Package: If both files contribute to a unified concept of window management, placing them in a single package like window is appropriate.

Separate Packages: If detection and closing are distinct operations with minimal overlap, separating them into windowdetect and windowclose packages can enhance modularity.

The goal is to group related functionalities while maintaining clear boundaries between different concerns.

5. Understanding Interfaces in Go
Interfaces:

In Go, an interface is a type that specifies a set of method signatures. Any type implementing these methods satisfies the interface, promoting flexibility and decoupling in your code.

Refactoring with Interfaces:

Given your Win32_Process struct and getLobbyPID function, you can introduce an interface to abstract the process querying behavior:

go
Copy
Edit
// Define the interface
type ProcessQuery interface {
    QueryProcesses(query string) ([]Win32_Process, error)
}

// Implement the interface
type WMIProcessQuery struct{}

func (WMIProcessQuery) QueryProcesses(query string) ([]Win32_Process, error) {
    var processes []Win32_Process
    err := wmi.Query(query, &processes)
    return processes, err
}

// Modify the function to use the interface
func getLobbyPID(pq ProcessQuery) (uint32, error) {
    query := fmt.Sprintf("SELECT Name, ProcessId FROM Win32_Process WHERE Name = '%s'", detection.LOBBY_WINDOW_NAME)

    for {
        processes, err := pq.QueryProcesses(query)
        if err == nil {
            if len(processes) > 0 {
                return processes[0].ProcessId, nil
            }
            return 0, fmt.Errorf("lobby window not found")
        }
        log.Printf("Process query failed: %v", err)
        time.Sleep(5 * time.Second)
    }
}
File Organization:

internal/mocks/process_query_mock.go: Contains mock implementations of the ProcessQuery interface for testing purposes.

close.go: Implements the WMIProcessQuery and utilizes getLobbyPID with this implementation.

main.go: Initializes necessary components and orchestrates the application's workflow.

This structure enhances testability by allowing you to inject mock implementations during testing, ensuring your logic is correctly validated.

6. Utilizing the pkg Directory
The pkg directory is typically used for code intended to be imported by other projects or for components shared across multiple internal applications. If you have functionalities like detecting or closing windows that could be reused, placing them in pkg makes sense.

Exporting Functions:

In Go, a function or type is exported (i.e., accessible from other packages) if its name starts with an uppercase letter. For example:

go
Copy
Edit
// In pkg/window/window.go
package window

func DetectWindow(name string) (Window, error) {
    // Implementation
}
Internal Usage:

Your internal packages can then import and utilize these exported functions:

go
Copy
Edit
// In internal/yourapp/yourfile.go
package yourapp

import "yourproject/pkg/window"

func someFunction() {
    win, err := window.DetectWindow("example")
    // Use win and handle err
}
This approach promotes code reuse and maintains a clear separation between shared utilities and application-specific logic.

By adhering to these practices and structures, you can create a Go project that is organized, maintainable, and scalable. If you have further questions or need additional clarification, feel free to ask!

You said:
For point 1, I was asking not about naming conventions, but what the terminology is to describe individual .go files within a package folder. I can't call them modules or packages, should I call them scripts or programs or something else?

For point 2, confirm you would combine DDD and layered architecture via subfolders within the internal directory? what would this look like? e.g. would you have a presentation folder, and another folder called application? does the application layer refer to the domain layer folder files?

For point 5, it seems like the interface is abstracting away the wmi.Query process, which would be useful if I wanted to substitute a different query method? I was actually thinking we would use it to abstract away the Win32_Process struct, so I could obtain Win32_Process from wmi.Query but could also generate "dummy" Win32_Process objects for testing purposes?

Certainly! Let's address each of your questions in detail:

1. Terminology for Individual .go Files Within a Package
In Go, individual .go files within a package don't have a specific terminology beyond being referred to as "source files" or "Go source files." Each file contributes to the overall functionality of the package. The key point is that all these files share the same package declaration at the top, indicating they belong to the same package. For example:

go
Copy
Edit
// In file1.go
package mypackage

// In file2.go
package mypackage
Both file1.go and file2.go are source files that collectively define the mypackage package.

2. Combining Domain-Driven Design (DDD) and Layered Architecture in Go Project Structure
Integrating DDD with a layered architecture in a Go project typically involves organizing your internal directory into subdirectories that represent different layers and domains of your application. Here's a common approach:

csharp
Copy
Edit
/internal
├── /app
│   ├── /interfaces    // Presentation Layer: Handles HTTP requests, CLI, etc.
│   ├── /application   // Application Layer: Orchestrates use cases and workflows
│   ├── /domain        // Domain Layer: Contains business logic, entities, and interfaces
│   └── /infrastructure// Infrastructure Layer: Data access, external services, etc.
└── /mocks             // Mock implementations for testing
Presentation Layer (interfaces): Manages user interactions and translates them into application actions.

Application Layer (application): Defines the application's use cases and coordinates between the presentation and domain layers.

Domain Layer (domain): Contains the core business logic, entities, value objects, and domain services.

Infrastructure Layer (infrastructure): Implements technical details like data persistence, external API calls, and other infrastructure concerns.

This structure promotes separation of concerns and aligns with DDD principles by clearly delineating between different aspects of your application.

5. Using Interfaces to Abstract Win32_Process for Testing
You're correct that interfaces can be used to abstract the Win32_Process struct, allowing you to create dummy data for testing purposes. Here's how you can achieve this:

Define an Interface for Process Retrieval:

go
Copy
Edit
// ProcessRetriever defines methods to retrieve process information.
type ProcessRetriever interface {
    GetProcessesByName(name string) ([]Win32_Process, error)
}
Implement the Interface Using WMI:

go
Copy
Edit
// WMIProcessRetriever retrieves processes using WMI queries.
type WMIProcessRetriever struct{}

func (w WMIProcessRetriever) GetProcessesByName(name string) ([]Win32_Process, error) {
    var processes []Win32_Process
    query := fmt.Sprintf("SELECT Name, ProcessId FROM Win32_Process WHERE Name = '%s'", name)
    err := wmi.Query(query, &processes)
    return processes, err
}
Modify Your Function to Use the Interface:

go
Copy
Edit
func getLobbyPID(pr ProcessRetriever) (uint32, error) {
    processes, err := pr.GetProcessesByName(detection.LOBBY_WINDOW_NAME)
    if err != nil {
        return 0, fmt.Errorf("failed to retrieve processes: %v", err)
    }
    if len(processes) == 0 {
        return 0, fmt.Errorf("lobby window not found")
    }
    return processes[0].ProcessId, nil
}
Create a Mock Implementation for Testing:

In your internal/mocks directory:

go
Copy
Edit
// MockProcessRetriever is a mock implementation of ProcessRetriever for testing.
type MockProcessRetriever struct {
    MockProcesses []Win32_Process
    MockError     error
}

func (m MockProcessRetriever) GetProcessesByName(name string) ([]Win32_Process, error) {
    return m.MockProcesses, m.MockError
}
Use the Mock in Your Tests:

go
Copy
Edit
func TestGetLobbyPID(t *testing.T) {
    mockRetriever := MockProcessRetriever{
        MockProcesses: []Win32_Process{
            {Name: detection.LOBBY_WINDOW_NAME, ProcessId: 1234},
        },
        MockError: nil,
    }
    pid, err := getLobbyPID(mockRetriever)
    if err != nil {
        t.Fatalf("expected no error, got %v", err)
    }
    if pid != 1234 {
        t.Fatalf("expected pid 1234, got %d", pid)
    }
}
File Organization:

internal/mocks/process_retriever_mock.go: Contains MockProcessRetriever.

internal/close/close.go: Implements WMIProcessRetriever and uses getLobbyPID.

cmd/main.go: Sets up dependencies and initializes the application.

By using interfaces in this manner, you can inject different implementations (real or mock) into your functions, facilitating easier testing and greater flexibility in your application design.

## Go toast

```chatGPT
go-toast is a Go library for creating Windows toast notifications. It allows you to send native Windows 10/11 notifications easily.

Installation
go get github.com/go-toast/toast

Usage
Modify your lobby_open case:

go
Copy
Edit
import "github.com/go-toast/toast"

func sendNotification(title, message string) {
	notification := toast.Notification{
		AppID:   "LoL Monitor",
		Title:   title,
		Message: message,
	}
	err := notification.Push()
	if err != nil {
		log.Printf("Failed to send notification: %v", err)
	}
}
Then, call it in your code:

go
Copy
Edit
case "lobby_open":
	log.Println("Lobby was opened")
	if time.Now().Before(endOfBreak) {
		log.Println("Attempting to close Lobby due to enforced break")
		sendNotification("League of Legends Blocked", "You're on a break! Try again later.")
		err := actions.CloseLeagueClient()
		if err != nil {
			log.Printf("Error: %v", err)
		}
	}
```

## using for loops on a range with channel

Why doesn't for event := range gameEvents {} exit immediately?
If gameEvents were a normal variable (not a channel), for event := range gameEvents {} would try to iterate over a finite set of values and exit when done.

However, because gameEvents is a channel, the range loop will keep waiting for new values, processing them as they come.

The loop only stops if the channel is closed (close(gameEvents)), which you currently do only when quit is received.

## It's always time...

time.Duration(15) * time.Minute
This expression multiplies 15 nanoseconds by 60 billion, which gives you a time.Duration that represents 15 minutes worth of time in nanoseconds.

## Passing by value vs pointer (reference)

```chatGPT
Passing by Value (config.Config)
When you pass a struct by value, you are passing a copy of the struct. The function gets a local copy, so modifications inside the function won't affect the original struct.

When to use passing by value:

Small structs: If the struct is small (only a few fields), passing it by value is usually efficient because it doesn’t involve a lot of memory overhead.

Immutability: If the function does not need to modify the original struct, passing by value is a good option. It ensures that the original struct remains unchanged, which can make reasoning about the program easier.

Avoiding side effects: If you want to avoid any unintended side effects or mutations of the original object outside the function, passing by value is safer.

Pros:

Avoids modifying the original struct.

Can be simpler to reason about in certain cases.

No risk of accidental mutation or sharing state.

Cons:

If the struct is large, passing it by value could involve unnecessary memory copying, which may impact performance.

Passing by Pointer (*config.Config)
When you pass a struct by pointer, you are passing a reference to the original struct. This means that any changes made to the struct inside the function will affect the original struct.

When to use passing by pointer:

Large structs: If the struct is large, passing it by pointer is generally more efficient because it avoids copying the entire struct. You're just passing a reference (a pointer) to the struct instead of duplicating its entire content.

Mutability: If the function needs to modify the struct’s fields (e.g., changing values inside cfg), passing by pointer is required because you're passing the address of the original struct, not a copy.

Consistency with other functions: If you need to ensure consistency across your application by passing a reference to the same instance of the struct, using pointers ensures that changes in one part of your code will be reflected in others.

Nil checks: If the struct is a complex object or contains expensive resources, passing by pointer can help avoid unnecessary copying while also providing an easy way to check if the struct is nil.

Pros:

More memory efficient for large structs.

Allows for modification of the original struct.

Reduces the overhead of copying large structs.

Cons:

Can lead to unintended side effects if not carefully managed.

The function can modify the original struct, which might not always be desired.

Decision Making
Use by value when:

You don't need to modify the original struct.

The struct is small and passing by value is not performance-intensive.

You want to avoid unintentional changes to the original struct.

Use by pointer when:

You need to modify the struct inside the function.

The struct is large and passing by value would incur unnecessary overhead.

You want all references to the struct to reflect changes made inside the function.

Conclusion
Since your config.Config is likely a configuration structure (potentially containing multiple fields that may be updated), and the function might need to read and modify it, passing by pointer is probably the better choice unless you're only accessing data without modification.

For example:

If EnforceBreak modifies cfg, pass by pointer.

If cfg is large and you don’t want to copy it every time, pass by pointer.

If you’re sure that the cfg struct will not be modified in EnforceBreak and is relatively small, passing by value would be simpler and safer.
```

and also

```ChatGPT
In Go, the & symbol is used to take the address of a variable or struct, meaning it creates a pointer to that variable or struct.

In your example:

go
Copy
Edit
type Config struct {
    DailyStartTime       string        `json:"dailyStartTime"`
    DailyEndTime         string        `json:"dailyEndTime"`
    BreakBetweenGames    time.Duration `json:"breakBetweenGames"`
    BreakBetweenSessions time.Duration `json:"breakBetweenSessions"`
    GamesPerSession      int           `json:"gamesPerSession"`
    MinGameDuration      time.Duration `json:"minGameDuration"`
}

func LoadConfig(filename string) (*Config, error) {
    file, err := os.Open(filename)
    if err != nil {
        fmt.Println("Config file not found, creating default config...")
        saveDefaultConfig(filename)
        return &defaultConfig, nil
    }
    // other logic
}
Explanation of & in &defaultConfig
In this code:

go
Copy
Edit
return &defaultConfig, nil
&defaultConfig creates a pointer to the defaultConfig struct, returning that pointer.

The LoadConfig function is returning a pointer to a Config object, hence the return type is *Config, which means a pointer to Config.

Why the & is used here:
defaultConfig is most likely a variable of type Config, and when you use &defaultConfig, you are passing a pointer to defaultConfig, not the value itself. This is because the return type of LoadConfig is *Config (a pointer to Config).

If you didn't use &, you would be returning the value of defaultConfig directly, which would not match the return type of *Config.

When and why to use &
When you want to return a pointer: If your function is supposed to return a pointer to an object (as in *Config), you need to use & to get the address of that object.

When you want to avoid copying large structs: Passing a pointer allows you to work with the original struct, rather than making copies, which can be inefficient for large objects. If you pass a struct by value (without using &), the function works with a copy of the struct.

When should you use &?
When you need a pointer: If you're working with a function that expects a pointer (e.g., *Config), you need to use & to create the pointer from a value.

When you want to modify the original data: If you want the function to modify the struct (or configuration, in this case), you pass a pointer (with &), so the function can modify the original object.

In your example, LoadConfig is creating and returning a pointer to a Config object (either from a file or a default config). You would use & in return &defaultConfig to return the address of defaultConfig, not a copy of it.

Summary:
The & symbol creates a pointer to a variable.

In the context of your LoadConfig function, it is used to return a pointer (*Config) to the caller.

You use & when you need to return or pass a reference (pointer) to a variable or struct, rather than a copy of the value.

If you're passing this pointer to another function that expects *Config, you're passing a reference to the original Config instance, and changes made to it will affect the original object.
```

## upper vs lowercase function names

In Go, functions that start with a lowercase letter (e.g., getProcessID) are unexported, meaning they are private to the package they are defined in. If getProcessID is defined in detection/detector.go but is not exported (i.e., it starts with a lowercase letter), it cannot be accessed from another package like actions.

```chatGPT

1. log.Printf:
Purpose: Used for logging messages, often with a timestamp and log level.

Usage: Outputs formatted text to the log, including additional context (e.g., timestamp).

Example:

go
Copy
Edit
log.Printf("User %s has logged in at %v", username, time.Now())
Key Characteristics:

Automatically includes a timestamp when logging.

Outputs to stderr by default.

Intended for general logging, especially in production code.

Can be configured for different logging levels and output formats (e.g., to a file).

2. fmt.Errorf:
Purpose: Used for creating formatted error messages.

Usage: Returns an error with a formatted message.

Example:

go
Copy
Edit
err := fmt.Errorf("failed to open file: %s", filename)
return err
Key Characteristics:

Returns an error type, so it’s useful for creating new error instances.

Often used to provide a more detailed message when an error occurs.

Does not print anything by itself (it simply returns an error object that can be logged or handled).

3. fmt.Sprintf:
Purpose: Used to format a string and return it without printing or logging it.

Usage: Returns a formatted string.

Example:

go
Copy
Edit
formattedString := fmt.Sprintf("User %s has %d points", username, points)
Key Characteristics:

Returns a string that can be stored or passed around in your program.

It doesn’t print anything by itself; you must explicitly print or log the result (e.g., using fmt.Println or log.Printf).

Commonly used to create strings that need to be printed, logged, or further processed.

Commonly Used Functions for Logging, Formatting, and Error Handling:
Here’s a list of other commonly used functions with similar behavior:

4. fmt.Println:
Purpose: Prints a formatted string to the standard output (stdout) followed by a newline.

Usage: Used for general output (e.g., debugging or showing results).

Example:

go
Copy
Edit
fmt.Println("Hello, world!")
5. fmt.Print:
Purpose: Prints a formatted string to the standard output without a newline at the end.

Usage: Useful when you want to print text without an automatic newline.

Example:

go
Copy
Edit
fmt.Print("Hello ")
fmt.Print("World!")
6. log.Fatal:
Purpose: Logs a message and then terminates the program with a non-zero exit status.

Usage: Used for critical errors where the program cannot continue running.

Example:

go
Copy
Edit
if err != nil {
    log.Fatal("Failed to connect to the database:", err)
}
Key Characteristics:

Like log.Printf, but it exits the program after logging the message.

7. log.Panic:
Purpose: Logs a message and then causes the program to panic (similar to throwing an exception).

Usage: Used for situations where the program is in an irrecoverable state.

Example:

go
Copy
Edit
if err != nil {
    log.Panic("Unexpected error occurred:", err)
}
Key Characteristics:

Similar to log.Fatal, but it allows recovery (if deferred functions handle the panic).

8. fmt.Scan / fmt.Scanln:
Purpose: Reads input from standard input (stdin) and parses it into variables.

Usage: Useful for reading user input.

Example:

go
Copy
Edit
var name string
fmt.Scanln(&name)
9. fmt.Sscanf:
Purpose: Reads formatted input from a string.

Usage: Similar to fmt.Scan, but it operates on a string instead of stdin.

Example:

go
Copy
Edit
var name string
fmt.Sscanf("John 25", "%s %d", &name, &age)
10. log.Println:
Purpose: Similar to log.Printf, but appends a newline automatically after logging the message.

Usage: Used for logging simple messages with automatic newlines.

Example:

go
Copy
Edit
log.Println("User logged in successfully")
```

# Initial brainstorming session with ChatGPT (abridged)

Me:
```
Help me develop a Windows service that will run constantly and help me manage my League of Legends habits. In particular, I need some sort of way of monitoring when the League of Legends client is opened, and when a game commences and concludes. As a separate window opens for the game compared to the lobby, I think it should be possible to monitor for this. I'm not sure of the correct terminology, so for now I'll call these two windows the client window and the game window, but please come up with some better terminology for us to use. I want to be able to forcibly close the client window when the game window closes, and optionally continue to close it if it reappears within 15 minutes. The idea is that I want to prevent myself from queuing back-to-back games. Ideally I'll measure the time that the game window has been open, so if it's less than 15 minutes we don't close the client window as the game was a remake and not a full game. Give me a recommendation and/or some options, with step by step instructions and/or code if you can develop the full solution.
```
ChatGPT:
```
The basic idea is to write a Windows service (for example, in C#) that runs a background timer (or uses event‐based notifications) to monitor the League of Legends processes and/or windows. In our discussion, let’s refer to the main League client (where you log in, queue, chat, etc.) as the Lobby and the in‐game window (which opens when a match starts) as the Match. The service will do the following:

Detect the Lobby and Match:
You have a couple of options here:

Process-based monitoring:
Use the System.Diagnostics namespace to poll for processes by name. (For example, the League client process might be called something like “LeagueClientUx” while the actual game might be “League of Legends”.)

Window-based monitoring:
Use the Windows API (via P/Invoke) to enumerate open windows and check their titles or class names. (Often the lobby and match windows have different titles or window class names.)

Either method can let you “see” when the Match appears and later disappears.

Measuring Match Duration:
When the Match window (in‐game) is detected, record the start time. When it is no longer present, compute the duration. If it was open for less than 15 minutes, assume the game was a remake and do not force-close the Lobby. Otherwise, if the match lasted 15 minutes or more, then you’ll later enforce the closing of the Lobby if it reappears within your set time window.

Forcibly Closing the Lobby:
To “force close” the Lobby window, you can send a close message (for example, via the Windows API’s PostMessage with WM_CLOSE) or simply kill the process using Process.Kill(). Be sure that your service has sufficient privileges to close the process.
You might also want to continue checking (say, for 15 minutes after a match ends) to see if the Lobby reopens—if it does, then you close it again.
```
Me:
```
1. The proposed implementation uses C# and Visual Studio. I have experience using Python in vscode. Is it possible to develop something equivalent using this language and IDE? 
2. Is the InstallUtil aspect required or optional? Having manual steps to create the service, perhaps using Windows Task Scheduler, would be ok and possibly preferred
```
ChatGPT:
```
Yes, you can absolutely develop this in Python using VS Code. Here’s how we can adjust the approach:

Python Implementation:

Instead of using C#, we can use Python libraries like psutil to monitor processes and pygetwindow to track windows.

We can log when the game starts and ends, measure the match duration, and automatically close the League client if it appears within 15 minutes after a full game.

Windows Task Scheduler Instead of a Service:

Instead of installing a Windows service, we can create a Python script that runs continuously and use Windows Task Scheduler to start it at boot.

Alternatively, we can create a scheduled task that runs the script periodically (e.g., every 10 seconds) to check for game activity.
```
Me:
```
Are there any downsides to having a Python script running continuously? I'm thinking of just checking every 1 minute to reduce the load on the system. How does the load compare between a Python script run constantly vs a Python script run periodically vs the C# approach discussed previously?

Would using Golang be another option? I'm actually interested in exploring Go and if I can develop this in vscode and it has benefits over the Python approach, this might be a preferred option.
```
ChatGPT:
```
Comparing System Load for Different Approaches
Python Script Running Continuously:

If implemented efficiently (e.g., using time.sleep(60) to wait between checks), CPU usage will be minimal.

However, Python has some overhead due to its interpreter and garbage collection, making it less efficient than compiled languages like C# or Go.

Memory usage will be slightly higher than a compiled binary but still manageable.

Python Script Run Periodically (via Task Scheduler):

Running the script every minute via Task Scheduler means Python starts up, checks processes, and exits.

The downside is the small overhead of repeatedly launching the Python interpreter, which may make this approach slightly less efficient than keeping a script running in the background.

This method may also cause delays in detection since it only runs at scheduled intervals.

C# Windows Service:

A compiled C# service runs natively and has lower memory and CPU usage than Python.

Services are optimized for background tasks and can use event-driven approaches (instead of polling), making them more efficient.

However, setting up a Windows service requires more work compared to a simple script.

Go (Golang) as an Alternative:

Pros:

Go produces a single compiled binary with minimal memory and CPU overhead.

Unlike Python, Go does not need an interpreter, so startup and runtime performance are better.

Go has built-in concurrency support (e.g., goroutines), making it efficient for monitoring tasks.

Cons:

Less mature ecosystem for Windows process monitoring compared to Python and C#.

Requires learning a new language (though Go is relatively simple).
```
ChatGPT (offered to investigate relevant Go packages)
```
Developing your League of Legends habit management tool in Go is a viable option, offering efficiency and the opportunity to explore a new language. Here's how you can approach this:

1. Monitoring Processes in Go:

Go's standard library provides the os and os/exec packages, which are useful for process management. However, detecting the start and stop of external processes like the League of Legends client and game requires a monitoring approach.

Polling Method: Periodically list all running processes to check for the presence or absence of specific processes. This method is straightforward but may not detect short-lived processes if the polling interval is too long.

Example using the os package:

  package main

  import (
      "os"
      "strconv"
      "syscall"
      "time"
  )

  func isProcessRunning(pid int) bool {
      process, err := os.FindProcess(pid)
      if err != nil {
          return false
      }
      // Sending signal 0 to a process will not kill it,
      // but will return an error if the process does not exist.
      err = process.Signal(syscall.Signal(0))
      return err == nil
  }

  func main() {
      pid := 1234 // Replace with the actual PID of the process you want to monitor
      for {
          if isProcessRunning(pid) {
              println("Process is running.")
          } else {
              println("Process is not running.")
          }
          time.Sleep(1 * time.Minute)
      }
  }
This code checks if a process with a specific PID is running every minute. Replace 1234 with the actual process ID of the League of Legends client or game.

Event-Driven Method: Utilize Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) to receive notifications when processes start or stop. This method is more efficient but requires additional packages.

Example using the ole and wmi packages:

  package main

  import (
      "fmt"
      "github.com/go-ole/go-ole"
      "github.com/go-ole/go-ole/oleutil"
      "time"
  )

  func main() {
      ole.CoInitialize(0)
      defer ole.CoUninitialize()

      unknown, _ := oleutil.CreateObject("WbemScripting.SWbemLocator")
      wmi, _ := unknown.QueryInterface(ole.IID_IDispatch)
      serviceRaw, _ := oleutil.CallMethod(wmi, "ConnectServer")
      service := serviceRaw.ToIDispatch()
      defer service.Release()

      query := "SELECT * FROM __InstanceCreationEvent WITHIN 1 WHERE TargetInstance ISA 'Win32_Process'"
      eventsRaw, _ := oleutil.CallMethod(service, "ExecNotificationQuery", query)
      events := eventsRaw.ToIDispatch()
      defer events.Release()

      for {
          eventRaw, _ := oleutil.CallMethod(events, "NextEvent")
          event := eventRaw.ToIDispatch()
          targetInstanceRaw, _ := oleutil.GetProperty(event, "TargetInstance")
          targetInstance := targetInstanceRaw.ToIDispatch()
          nameRaw, _ := oleutil.GetProperty(targetInstance, "Name")
          name := nameRaw.ToString()
          fmt.Println("Process started:", name)
          event.Release()
          targetInstance.Release()
          nameRaw.Clear()
      }
  }
This code listens for process creation events and prints the name of any process that starts. You can modify it to detect the League of Legends client or game by checking if name matches the process name of interest.

2. Detecting Window Events in Go:

Monitoring window events, such as when a game window opens or closes, is more complex in Go. The standard library does not provide direct support for this, but you can use external packages like github.com/lxn/win to interact with the Windows API.

Example using the win package:

package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "syscall"
    "time"
    "unsafe"

    "github.com/lxn/win"
)

func windowExists(windowName string) bool {
    hwnd := win.FindWindow(nil, syscall.StringToUTF16Ptr(windowName))
    return hwnd != 0
}

func main() {
    windowName := "League of Legends" // Replace with the actual window title
    for {
        if windowExists(windowName) {
            fmt.Println("Window is open.")
        } else {
            fmt.Println("Window is closed.")
        }
        time.Sleep(1 * time.Minute)
    }
}
This code checks every minute if a window with the specified title exists. Replace "League of Legends" with the actual title of the game window.

3. Closing Processes in Go:

To forcibly close the League of Legends client after a game ends, you can terminate its process using the os/exec package.

Example:

package main

import (
    "os/exec"
)

func killProcess(processName string) error {
    cmd := exec.Command("taskkill", "/IM", processName, "/F")
    return cmd.Run()
}

func main() {
    err := killProcess("LeagueClient.exe") // Replace with the actual process name
    if err != nil {
        println("Failed to kill process:", err.Error())
    } else {
        println("Process killed successfully.")
    }
}
This code forcefully terminates the process with the specified name. Replace "LeagueClient.exe" with the actual process name of the League of Legends client.

4. Implementing the 15-Minute Cooldown:

After detecting that a game has ended, you can implement a cooldown period by waiting for 15 minutes before allowing the client to be reopened. This can be achieved using Go's time package.

Example:

package main

import (
    "time"
)

func main() {
    println("Game ended. Starting 15-minute cooldown.")
    time.Sleep(15 * time.Minute)
    println("Cooldown ended. You can start a new game now.")
}
This code pauses the program for 15 minutes after a game ends. You can integrate this into your main monitoring loop to enforce the cooldown period.

Conclusion:

Developing your habit management tool in Go is feasible and can be efficient. While Go's standard library provides basic process management capabilities, detecting window events may require external packages and interaction with the Windows API.
```
Me:
```
It occurs to me that I probably need to use the event driven approach if I want the process to close the main client window as soon as the game window closes, is that a fair statement? 

Alternatively (and/or), is there any argument for having two processes, one that checks every minute or so for the lobby window and if it exists, start up the game close process which monitors more frequently, say every 3 seconds?

Another consideration is how easy it would be for me to package up this solution for others to use? Initially I was thinking it would just be for me, but if it's possible to give people something that they can download and install, this might be really useful for others.
```
ChatGPT:
```
Yes, if you want the client window to close immediately when the game ends, an event-driven approach is the best option. This would allow you to listen for process termination events in real time rather than relying on periodic checks.

Alternatively, your idea of a hybrid approach is valid:

A low-frequency process (e.g., every minute) checks if the client is running and starts the high-frequency monitoring process when a game begins.

A high-frequency process (e.g., every 3 seconds) actively monitors for the game window closing and then shuts down the client.

This balances efficiency (by avoiding constant monitoring) while ensuring quick reaction times when needed.

Packaging for Others
If you want to make this easy for others to use:

Go Advantage: Go compiles into a single executable, making distribution easy—no dependencies needed.

Python Consideration: If using Python, you'd need to package it with pyinstaller to create an executable (.exe) for Windows users.

Installation & Setup: A lightweight installer (like NSIS or Inno Setup) could bundle everything together for a smooth user experience.
```
Me:
```
Let's go with Go language using the event driven approach (ole/wmi approach). What information do you need to provide me with a complete solution? For example, I can try starting up the client and/or playing a game to see what the window names are. What else do you need?

Can you also give me step by step instructions to set up my environment ready for this project? I'm thinking I'll need to install go? Create a virtual / project environment? Github repo? Directory structure? This is my first go project so hold my hand a bit :)
```
ChatGPT (heavily abriged):
```
1. Go environment setup

Download and install Go from the official site: https://go.dev/dl/
Install the Go extension
Choose a directory for your project
Open a terminal (Terminal → New Terminal in VS Code) and navigate to your chosen directory
Initialize a new Go module (this sets up dependencies properly)

go mod init github.com/yourusername/LoLMonitor

You'll need some external Go packages for process monitoring and interacting with Windows APIs. Install them with:

go get github.com/go-ole/go-ole
go get github.com/go-ole/go-ole/oleutil
go get github.com/lxn/win

2. Gathering necessary information

Powershell:
Get-Process | Where-Object { $_.MainWindowTitle -ne "" } | Select-Object ProcessName, MainWindowTitle
```
Me:
```
I was thinking it might be nice to have an optional config file that could allow the user to define how many consecutive games are allowed (some people advocate playing 3 games and no more), or a particular time after which no more games can be played. Would this be possible within the Go framework?

I'm also wondering about user interaction - if someone tries to open the client and the process closes it, is there a way to display a message to the user to tell them what is going on?

I'm also curious whether the vanguard system that is designed to stop cheating will have any issue with all of this. I wouldn't want to get my account banned (or others' accounts)

What other features might I consider from a user perspective? It would be good to plan all these out before I start, in case it impacts the overall design decisions. 
```
ChatGPT:
```
Optional Configuration File
Yes, it’s very feasible in Go to have a configuration file that users can edit. You have several options:

JSON or YAML:
Use the Go standard library (encoding/json) or a package like gopkg.in/yaml.v2 to parse settings. You could allow users to specify parameters such as the number of consecutive games allowed or a daily time limit.

Example Config Structure (JSON):

{
    "maxConsecutiveGames": 3,
    "dailyEndTime": "22:00",
    "cooldownMinutes": 15
}
Then in your Go code, read this file at startup and use the values in your logic.

User Interaction
When the client is closed by your program, you might want to inform the user. There are a couple of strategies for this:

Windows Notifications:
You can use a package such as go-toast to display native Windows toast notifications.

Popup Dialogs:
Alternatively, you could call Windows API functions (for example, using the syscall or an external package) to display a message box.

Example with go-toast:

package main

import "github.com/go-toast/toast"

func notifyUser(message string) {
    notification := toast.Notification{
        AppID: "LoL Habit Manager",
        Title: "League Client Closed",
        Message: message,
    }
    notification.Push()
}
This way, if the client is force-closed, you can display a message explaining that it was closed to enforce the cooldown or habit restrictions.

Concerns About Vanguard and Account Safety
Riot’s Vanguard anti-cheat system is designed primarily to prevent cheating by detecting unauthorized modifications or manipulations within the game’s memory. A monitoring tool that:

Only detects window/process events,

Sends a close signal to the client without altering game data or interfering with gameplay,
is generally considered an external utility.

That said, there are some important considerations:

Risk of False Positives:
Even if your tool is benign, there’s always a slight risk that the anti-cheat system might flag unusual behavior. However, most discussions online suggest that utilities which merely kill or block the client (without any memory injection or manipulation) have not led to bans.

User Responsibility:
It’s wise to include a disclaimer in your tool and documentation advising users to use it at their own risk and to verify with current Riot policies if they have concerns.

For additional peace of mind, you might search through recent discussions on reputable League of Legends community forums or Riot support pages for any updated guidance on third-party utilities.

Other Features to Consider (User Perspective)
Before finalizing your design, you might consider these enhancements:

Flexible Game Limits:
Allow users to configure not only the maximum consecutive games but also a daily or weekly playtime limit.

Logging and Statistics:
Provide logs or even a simple dashboard showing how many games have been played, total playtime, and cooldown periods.

Scheduling/Quiet Hours:
Allow users to specify “quiet hours” during which the client is automatically prevented from opening.

User Prompts and Override Options:
Offer an option for users to confirm if they really want to bypass the restriction (perhaps via a notification that asks for confirmation).

Grace Periods and Reminders:
Notify users as they approach their limit, giving them a gentle reminder rather than an abrupt closure.

Environment and Packaging Considerations
Development Environment:
With Go, you’ll end up with a single executable, which is a major benefit if you plan to distribute this tool to others.

Distribution:
Using Go’s cross-compilation features, you can easily build for different Windows architectures.

Installer Options:
You might consider using a tool like Inno Setup or NSIS to create a simple installer that places the executable, configuration file, and any necessary documentation in the right locations.
```
Me:
```
How difficult would it be to make this process work not only on Windows but also on MacOS and/or Linux (if League works on Linux). I'm not sure what the split of users on these systems might be, but am curious. This might impact, for example, the choice of notification approach (e.g. message box might be cross platform where the toast might be windows only, so some other approach is needed for Mac and perhaps OS detection or separate exe files to do the right thing)
```
ChatGPT:
```
Expanding your League of Legends habit management tool to support macOS and Linux involves several considerations, including game compatibility, cross-platform development challenges, and user notification methods. Let's explore these aspects:

League of Legends Compatibility Across Operating Systems

Windows: League of Legends is fully supported on Windows, making it the primary platform for both gameplay and related tools.

macOS: The game is playable on macOS, but official support is limited. Riot Games' system requirements indicate support for macOS versions up to 11, with ongoing development for compatibility with newer versions like macOS 12 and 13. 
SUPPORT-LEAGUEOFLEGENDS.RIOTGAMES.COM

Linux: Official support for League of Legends on Linux is absent. While community-driven methods, such as using Wine or Lutris, have enabled gameplay in the past, the introduction of Riot's Vanguard anti-cheat system has rendered these methods ineffective. 
LUTRIS.NET

Cross-Platform Development Considerations

Feasibility: Developing a cross-platform tool is achievable but requires addressing differences in system APIs, process management, and user notification systems across operating systems.

Process Monitoring: Each OS has distinct methods for monitoring and interacting with processes. For instance, Windows uses the Windows API, macOS utilizes the Cocoa framework, and Linux relies on system calls and libraries like procfs.

User Notifications: Notification systems vary: Windows employs toast notifications, macOS uses the User Notifications framework, and Linux environments may differ based on the desktop environment (e.g., GNOME, KDE).

Approaches to Cross-Platform Development

Unified Codebase with Conditional Compilation:

Write a single codebase with platform-specific sections using conditional compilation directives. This approach maintains consistency but can become complex as platform-specific code increases.

Platform-Specific Modules:

Develop separate modules for each OS that handle platform-specific functionalities, while sharing common logic. This modular approach enhances maintainability.

Cross-Platform Libraries:

Utilize libraries that abstract platform differences. For example, the fyne package in Go provides a cross-platform GUI toolkit, though its suitability depends on project requirements.

User Notification Strategies

Windows: Implement notifications using the Windows Notification Platform or external libraries like go-toast.

macOS: Use the native User Notifications framework to display alerts.

Linux: Leverage desktop environment tools such as libnotify for GNOME-based systems.

Conclusion

While extending your tool to macOS is feasible, the lack of official support for League of Legends on Linux, coupled with the challenges posed by the Vanguard anti-cheat system, makes Linux support impractical. Focusing on Windows and potentially macOS would provide the most value to users.

If you decide to proceed with cross-platform development, careful planning and testing are essential to address the unique challenges presented by each operating system.

Me:
```
Has this sort of thing been done before? Am I reinventing the wheel? Or is my idea unique and/or better than the alternative implementations? (I might still want to build it for myself as a project to gain skills in Go anyway, but this seems like a sensible thing to check first...)

ChatGPT:
```
Your initiative to develop a tool that manages and limits playtime for "League of Legends" (LoL) is both thoughtful and innovative. While there are existing tools and methods aimed at tracking or managing gaming habits, your proposed solution offers unique functionalities that are not fully addressed by current alternatives.

Existing Solutions:

Playtime Tracking Tools:

Wasted on LoL: This tool calculates the total hours a player has spent on LoL by analyzing game data associated with their summoner name. It provides insights into overall playtime but does not offer features to limit or control gaming sessions. 
WASTED ON LOL

General Habit-Tracking Applications:

Habitica: A gamified habit-tracking app that encourages users to build positive habits and increase productivity. While effective for general habit formation, it lacks specific integrations with gaming platforms like LoL to monitor or control playtime directly. 
HABITICA.COM

System-Level Controls:

Microsoft's App and Game Limits: For users within the Microsoft ecosystem, there are built-in features to set app and game limits. However, these controls are broad and may not offer the granularity or customization that dedicated gamers seek. 
MICROSOFT SUPPORT

Community Discussions:

Players have expressed interest in tools that can help limit their LoL playtime. For instance, a Reddit user inquired about methods to restrict themselves to a certain number of games per day, highlighting a demand for such solutions. 
REDDIT

Your Proposed Solution:

Your concept stands out by aiming to:

Monitor Active Gameplay: Actively track when the LoL client is running.

Enforce Playtime Limits: Automatically close the game client after a predefined number of matches or a set duration.

Provide User Notifications: Inform users when limits are approaching or have been reached.

Offer Customization: Allow users to set personalized limits and schedules.

This level of integration and control tailored specifically for LoL players is not prevalent in existing tools, making your idea both unique and potentially beneficial to the gaming community.

Conclusion:

While there are tools that track playtime or assist in habit formation, a dedicated application that actively manages and enforces playtime limits for "League of Legends" appears to be a novel concept. Developing this tool not only addresses a gap in the current offerings but also provides you with an excellent opportunity to enhance your skills in Go and contribute meaningfully to the gaming community.

For the "suggested directory structure", this only includes a few .go files. I was thinking it might have folders (e.g. src), including something for the final exe that someone might download as a standalone file. Is there a typical structure for a Go project that I could use?
```
ChatGPT:
```
Yes! In Go, there isn't a single "official" project structure, but there are best practices based on conventions followed by the community. Given that you are creating a tool that could be packaged as a standalone executable, a well-structured directory layout would help keep things organized.

Recommended Go Project Structure

Explanation of Key Directories
cmd/: Holds the main application entry point (main.go). This is useful if you ever extend the project with multiple executables.

internal/: Contains application logic that isn’t meant to be imported by other projects.

detection/: Manages process/window detection (via WMI/OLE).

config/: Handles configuration settings (e.g., JSON file for user preferences).

actions/: Executes necessary actions like closing the client, enforcing cooldowns, sending notifications.

logging/: Implements structured logging for debugging.

utils/: Helper functions that don’t fit elsewhere.

assets/: Stores static files (e.g., notification sounds, icons for UI popups).

build/: Output directory for compiled binaries.

scripts/: Installation, deployment, and automation scripts.

docs/: Documentation files (e.g., how to install, how it works).

go.mod/go.sum: Defines dependencies for Go modules.

Compiling the Executable
Once development is complete, you can build the final binary using:
go build -o build/league-habit-manager ./cmd/league-habit-manager

For Windows:
go build -o build/league-habit-manager.exe ./cmd/league-habit-manager


The cmd/ directory is used when a Go project might have multiple executables in the future. Placing the main entry point inside cmd/league-habit-manager/ makes it easier to add other executables later if needed.

For example:

cmd/
├── league-habit-manager/  # Main application
│   └── main.go
├── another-tool/          # Hypothetical future tool
│   └── main.go
If your project will only ever have one executable, you can simplify this to cmd/main.go, but using cmd/league-habit-manager/ follows Go community conventions and scales better.


Why separate folders for detection/, config/, etc.?
Instead of putting everything in a single script, Go prefers modularity. Each folder represents a package that contains related functionality.

detection/ → Detects LoL client and game window events

config/ → Handles user settings, like cooldown time

actions/ → Contains logic to take actions (e.g., closing the client)

logging/ → Manages structured logs for debugging

Each folder may contain multiple .go files, or just one if the functionality is small. Example:

internal/detection/
├── processes.go   # Detects processes
├── windows.go     # Detects window titles
Go encourages structuring by concern rather than just having "scripts."


In Go, the internal/ directory is used for private packages that shouldn't be imported by external projects.

src/ is not commonly used in Go projects (unlike Python or Linux projects).


Is go.mod similar to Python's requirements.txt?
Yes, but more powerful.

requirements.txt lists dependencies manually.

go.mod does this automatically when you use go get.

It also specifies the Go version and ensures dependencies are managed properly.

Example go.mod:

module github.com/yourname/league-habit-manager

go 1.21

require (
    github.com/some/library v1.2.3
)



If you don’t plan on having:

Installation scripts (e.g., auto-run setup)

Automation scripts (e.g., auto-build and package)

Deployment scripts

Then you don’t need a scripts/ folder. You can remove it!



What is go.sum and how is it created?
go.sum is like a lock file in Python (pip freeze > requirements.txt).

It ensures dependency integrity so builds are repeatable.

Created automatically when you run:

sh
Copy
Edit
go mod tidy
or

sh
Copy
Edit
go get some/library
You don’t need to manually edit it.

```
Me:
```
I have set up my folder structure as follows:

├── .gitignore
├── LICENSE        
├── README.md      
├── build
├── cmd
│   └── lolmonitor 
│       └── main.go
├── devlog.md      
├── go.mod
├── go.sum
├── internal       
│   ├── actions    
│   ├── config     
│   └── detection
└── scripts

However, I didn't immediately follow the advice to run 

go mod init github.com/alextgould/lolmonitor

and instead manually created a repo at github.com and then cloned the repo to my local drive. Is it too late to run a go mod init to get things working correctly?

I suspect I'll also still need to run 

go get github.com/go-ole/go-ole
go get github.com/go-ole/go-ole/oleutil
go get github.com/lxn/win

now/soon, but please confirm if these are still the correct modules to get, or if any additional ones need to be included.

Also, I ran the powershell command and can confirm there are three relevant window names:

ProcessName       MainWindowTitle
-----------       ---------------
Riot Client       Riot Client
League of Legends League of Legends (TM) Client
LeagueClientUx    League of Legends

The first one here is the general client, which opens if you need to update the game. The second one is the "lobby" while the last one is an actual "game". I'm not sure if we need ProcessName, MainWindowTitle or both, so I've retained both columns.

After responding to the above questions, you can now, based on everything we've talked about so far, go ahead and write me some starter code. I'm expecting
* clear directions on where each file should be placed
* comments in the code, following best practices, also calling out if there are things that are likely to need my input / review
* an event-driven approach, so the detecting of the Match window opening and closing occurs fairly immediately
* a JSON config file with the following parameters:
{
    "dailyStartTime": "04:00",
    "dailyEndTime": "22:00",
    "breakBetweenGames": "00:15",
    "breakBetweenSessions": "01:00",
    "gamesPerSession": 3,
    "minGameDuration": "00:15"
}
* key program logic is as follows:
  - the Lobby window will close if there is no Match window currently active and it's before dailyStartTime or after dailyEndTime
  - when a Match window opens, we record the current time (e.g. gameStartTime)
  - when a Match window closes, we record the current time (e.g. gameEndTime)
  - if the elapsed time (gameEndTime - gameStartTime) is less than minGameDuration, ignore the game (i.e. reset gameStartTime and reset gameEndTime to what it was before the latest game started, and don't apply the subsequent rules listed below), otherwise increment a counter of games played (e.g. sessionGames) and apply the rest of the logic below
  - if breakBetweenGames is non-zero, the Lobby window will be forcibly closed when the Match window closes (i.e. this is core functionality and will always happen unless breakBetweenGames is set to "00:00")
  - if the Lobby window opens before the time is later than gameEndTime + breakBetweenGames, the Lobby window will be forcibly closed and a toast notification will appear indicating the situation (e.g. lolmonitor is enforcing a break between games. The last game ended at X and your break of X will end at X)
  - if the sessionGames counter has reached the gamesPerSession threshold and the Lobby Window opens before the time is later than gameEndTime + breakBetweenSessions, the Lobby window will be forcibly closed and a toast notification will appear indicating the situation (e.g. lolmonitor is enforcing a break between sessions. The last game of the last session ended at X and your break of X will end at X)
  - once the time exceeds gameEndTime + breakBetweenSessions, the sessionGames counter is reset to 0, allowing the Lobby window to be opened again

  * A few optional extras:
   - I'm thinking it might be worth including the window names as parameters in the JSON config file, so if the windows happen to be renamed it's easy to update the config file as a quick fix, without having to redownload the whole application, however this might also make the JSON config file less user friendly
   - When the exe file is first run, or if errors occur due to poor user input, it would be good to create and/or update the config file to default values (which can match those shown above)
   - I'm more used to variables that look like game_start_time rather than gameStartTime, so if there isn't a strong convention of using camelCase in Go, I'd rather use underscores in my variables
   - I suspect this won't be a problem, but ensure the time values used allow for someone to have a session that starts late one day and ends early the next day, assuming they don't have a dailyStartTime constraint (i.e. they have it set to "00:00"), i.e. it's just based on the break times and end times and there's nothing special about midnight and moving from one day to the next
```

At this point I copy the resulting code into my repo and start chatting with ChatGPT Copilot:

```
GitHub Copilot
Yes, the WITHIN 1 clause in the WMI query specifies that WMI should check for changes every 1 second. This means that even in the "event-driven" approach in detector_4.go, WMI is still polling internally at the specified interval. The difference is that WMI handles the polling for you and only notifies your application when an event occurs, which can simplify your code and reduce the application's direct involvement in polling.

Is it Really Different from Polling?
Detector_3.go: Your application directly queries WMI every second, which is explicit polling.
Detector_4.go: WMI itself performs the polling internally (based on the WITHIN clause) and notifies your application only when an event occurs. This is more efficient in terms of application logic but still involves polling under the hood.
Impact on System Resources
The impact of polling or WMI event subscriptions on system resources is generally minimal, especially for lightweight queries like checking for specific processes. The actual CPU usage depends on:

Polling Interval: Shorter intervals (e.g., 1 second) consume more resources than longer intervals (e.g., 5 seconds).
Query Complexity: Simple queries like checking for process names are fast and efficient.
System Load: On a modern computer, the impact of such queries is negligible.
Estimating Resource Usage
If your computer's "brain power" is 100%, the resource usage for this kind of polling or WMI query would likely be well below 1%. Here's why:

A single WMI query or polling operation is lightweight and typically completes in milliseconds.
Modern CPUs are highly efficient and can handle thousands of such operations per second without noticeable impact.
Are You Overthinking It?
Yes, you might be overthinking the impact. For a task like monitoring a couple of processes, the resource usage is negligible on modern hardware. Unless you're running this on a very low-powered device or in an environment with strict resource constraints, the difference between polling and WMI event subscriptions is unlikely to be significant in terms of performance.

Recommendations
Stick with Simplicity:

If the polling approach in detector.go or detector_3.go works well and is easy to maintain, there's no need to overcomplicate things with WMI event subscriptions.
Use a reasonable polling interval (e.g., 1-5 seconds) to balance responsiveness and resource usage.
Optimize Only if Necessary:

If you notice performance issues (unlikely), consider optimizing the polling interval or switching to WMI event subscriptions.
Measure Resource Usage:

Use tools like Task Manager or perfmon on Windows to measure the actual CPU and memory usage of your application. This will give you a clearer picture of its impact.

If I'm considering going with the go-ole approach used in detector.go, or the StackExchange/wmi approach used in detector_3.go, how should I assess this decision? Is one module more reputable, or based on the other one? Both implementations are around 80 lines. The detector_3.go version seems a bit simpler to read (although I know SQL which is similar to WML). Is one more efficient than the other?

GitHub Copilot
When deciding between the go-ole approach (used in detector.go) and the StackExchange/wmi approach (used in detector_3.go), you should consider the following factors:

1. Reputation and Maintenance of the Libraries
go-ole:

A general-purpose library for interacting with COM objects in Go.
Well-maintained and widely used for various Windows-specific tasks, not just WMI.
Offers flexibility but requires more low-level handling (e.g., managing COM objects and interfaces manually).
Suitable if you need to interact with other COM-based APIs beyond WMI.
StackExchange/wmi:

A higher-level library specifically designed for querying WMI.
Maintained by StackExchange, a reputable organization.
Simpler to use for WMI queries, as it abstracts away the complexities of COM.
Limited to WMI-related tasks, so it’s less flexible than go-ole.
Recommendation: If you only need WMI functionality, StackExchange/wmi is simpler and more focused. If you anticipate needing broader COM functionality, go-ole is more versatile.

2. Readability and Simplicity
go-ole:

Requires more boilerplate code to initialize COM, query WMI, and manage object lifetimes.
Less intuitive for developers unfamiliar with COM or OLE programming.
The code in detector.go is harder to read and maintain compared to detector_3.go.
StackExchange/wmi:

Provides a clean and simple API for querying WMI.
The code in detector_3.go is easier to read and maintain, especially for developers familiar with SQL-like queries.
Recommendation: If simplicity and readability are priorities, StackExchange/wmi is the better choice.

3. Efficiency
go-ole:

Directly interacts with COM objects, which may offer slightly better performance for complex operations.
However, the overhead of managing COM objects manually can offset this advantage for simple tasks like querying WMI.
StackExchange/wmi:

Uses reflection and marshaling to interact with WMI, which may introduce a small performance overhead.
For simple WMI queries (like checking for processes), the performance difference is negligible compared to go-ole.
Recommendation: For your use case (simple WMI queries), the performance difference between the two approaches is minimal. Choose based on other factors like readability and maintainability.

4. Flexibility
go-ole:

Offers more flexibility for interacting with other COM-based APIs beyond WMI.
If you need to extend your application to interact with other Windows components (e.g., Excel, Word, or Shell APIs), go-ole is a better choice.
StackExchange/wmi:

Limited to WMI queries and does not support other COM-based APIs.
Simpler but less flexible.
Recommendation: If you foresee needing broader Windows API interactions, go-ole is more future-proof.

5. Community and Ecosystem
go-ole:

Has a larger community and more examples for general COM programming.
More versatile, so it’s used in a wider range of projects.
StackExchange/wmi:

Focused on WMI, so the community and examples are more limited.
However, it’s sufficient for WMI-specific tasks.
Recommendation: If you value a larger community and ecosystem, go-ole is a better choice.

6. Your Familiarity
If you’re comfortable with SQL-like queries (WQL), StackExchange/wmi will feel more natural.
If you’re familiar with COM programming or need to learn it for other reasons, go-ole might be a better fit.
Summary of Recommendations
Factor	go-ole (detector.go)	StackExchange/wmi (detector_3.go)
Reputation	Well-maintained	Reputable and focused
Readability	Harder to read	Simpler and cleaner
Efficiency	Slightly better	Negligible difference
Flexibility	More flexible	Limited to WMI
Community	Larger ecosystem	Smaller, WMI-specific
Familiarity	Requires COM knowledge	SQL/WQL familiarity is enough
Final Recommendation
For your specific use case (monitoring processes via WMI), StackExchange/wmi (detector_3.go) is the better choice:

It’s simpler to read and maintain.
It’s focused on WMI, which aligns with your requirements.
The performance difference is negligible for your use case.
However, if you anticipate needing broader COM functionality in the future, consider using go-ole. Let me know if you’d like further clarification or adjustments!

Let's say I want to keep a copy of detector_2.go, detector.go, detector_4.go, just in case I change my mind. What's the best approach - create a "to_delete" folder somewhere? I assume when I run detector_test.go it will be good to have a single file in that package directory to avoid confusion etc

GitHub Copilot
Yes, creating a separate folder (e.g., to_delete or archive) is a good approach to keep backup copies of files you might want to revisit later. This avoids cluttering the main package directory and ensures that only the active file is used when running tests or building the project.

I originally used

go get github.com/go-ole/go-ole go get github.com/go-ole/go-ole/oleutil go get github.com/lxn/win

What commands will I use to remove these, and then to instead use "github.com/StackExchange/wmi"

GitHub Copilot
To remove the unused dependencies and add the new one, you can use the following commands:

1. Remove Unused Dependencies
Go modules automatically clean up unused dependencies when you run go mod tidy. This will remove github.com/go-ole/go-ole, github.com/go-ole/go-ole/oleutil, and github.com/lxn/win if they are no longer referenced in your code.

Run:

go mod tidy

2. Add the New Dependency
To ensure github.com/StackExchange/wmi is included in your project, run:

go get github.com/StackExchange/wmi

Explanation:
go mod tidy: Cleans up your go.mod and go.sum files by removing unused dependencies and adding any missing ones.
go get: Adds the specified dependency to your project and updates the go.mod and go.sum files.
```

A critical thing happened at this point
* Copilot started having issues, with insertions happening at the wrong spot and code changes that didn't make sense, strongly reminiscent of when you ask ChatGPT for advice and at some point you realise it just doesn't understand
* I was able to get my detection working, but this involved 
  * reviewing some of the code in the wmi package docstrings and codebase in github and asking questions of ChatGPT to properly understand things
  * simplifying things down, removing some of the artifacts of the back-and-forth I'd been doing with Copilot (e.g. removing automated tests with simulated processes and just having a manual test which once working was probably sufficient for me)
  * writing my own code in Go (see below) that displayed all the new windows being created, as one of the window names wasn't correct
  * using my deductive skills and then working with Copilot/ChatGPT to implement go routines so as to test for the game window opening while the lobby window was open (as the original code was blocking, waiting for the lobby to close)
* I realised that as good as it is to have ChatGPT/Copilot there making things quicker for me, there's still a lot to be said for using it as a tool to gain understanding and then using your understanding to solve problems, rather than relying on it to solve all your problems for you

```go
// Flag new processes (useful for confirming window names)
for _, process := range processes {
    if !activeWindows[process.Name] {
        log.Printf("New process detected: %s", process.Name)
    }
}
```
